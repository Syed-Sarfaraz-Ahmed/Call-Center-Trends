# Call-Center-Trends

The task 🛠️

Create a dashboard in Power BI that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. The Call Centre Manager is looking for an accurate overview of long-term trends in customer and agent behaviour. 

My solution 👨🏻‍💻 

After cleaning and modelling the data to a star schema, my solution was to create a dashboard that answered the KPIs, focusing on the following points: 

🟢Overall calls answered, abandoned, and resolved

🟢Calls sorted by topic

🟢Call volume per month

🟢Customer satisfaction rating

🟢Agent’s performance quadrant

As part of my PwC Virtual Internship, I created a dashboard in Power BI that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.
